Email fields in Angular JS and Bootstrap
========================================

Examples of validation, messaging, icons and other behaviors with input
fields with a type of 'email'. Created with Angular JS 1.4 and Bootstrap styles.

These examples have error reporting built into the HTML page. I might try an
alternate version next that places this logic somewhere else to clean up
the page.
