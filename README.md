# Code Studies

Various small AngularJS, Bootstrap and JavaScript code studies. These have typically originated as Plunkers, or will find their way there eventually. Some of these will make their way into articles on my website [deepgraysea.com/](http://deepgraysea.com/).

My plunker site, where most of these came from, is [plnkr.co/users/mikeym](http://plnkr.co/users/mikeym).
